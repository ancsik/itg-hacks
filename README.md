# itg-hacks
useful stuff for running an ITG machine

### notes
basic command line knowledge is assumed as these are just bash util scripts
 1. install by copying the scripts to a convenient place on your system ('git clone' is fine too)
 2. symbin is your friend for easy separation of install location and PATH
